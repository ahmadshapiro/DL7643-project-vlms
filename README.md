# Vision Language Models - [WIP]
Final team project for the class DL CS 7643 at Georgia Tech, Spring 2024. Team: Deep Thinkers.

The design of the code repository aims to be modular, dependencies minimized with async development and parallelisms between tasks in mind.

Each code change has an individual commit. A merge to main will require a PR.

A code LGTM is not necessary for a PR merge due to modular design of code repository.

Each of the two modules can have its own set of requirements, easily installed separatelly in a virtual env. 

Current repository structure is:

```
.
├── assets
├── dataset
├── modules
│   ├── ahmad_conditional_visual
│   └── denisa_vlm_reasoners
├── requirements
└── scripts

```
